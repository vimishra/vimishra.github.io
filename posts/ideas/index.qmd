# 3 Ideas every week

This is a set of ideas that I am gathering from James Clear's newsletter - to be honest, this is the only newsletter that I read. The ideas in this are fantastic and I am writing them down here so I can review them and get inspired later.

## Reading and Writing

To achieve time travel, read. To achieve immortality, write. [Original Link](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/august-15-2024)

## Permanent and Impermanent thoughts

Consider the difference between rain and drinking water.

When you drink water, you imbibe it and it becomes part of you. As opposed to that, rain will wash off of you in a few mins and the sun would return.

Be wise in claiming your thoughts and feelings. Is it rain or is it water that you are drinking? Some of this is temporary and other is permanent. Be wise to understand the difference.

## Bold Things

Do bold things with a friendly and pleasant demeanor.

Imagine that you are watching two concert pianists - both of them are playing an exceedingly difficult piece. One of them has a face of agony as if she is enduring the piece while the other is smiling like they are truly enjoying. Which one would you prefer to see.

Remember this - difficult things done with a pleasant and smiling demeanor add a lot more value than doing them gritting and white knuckling.

## Be grateful that you don't have the things that you don't want.

Bob Dylan on the advice his father gave to him.

> Even if you don’t have all the things you want, be grateful for the things you don’t have that you don’t want.

## Power of reading

You feel that you are alone in what you suffer. But then you read, and you find out that you are not alone and there are people that have gone before you that have suffered. **James Baldwin** wrote in LIFE magazine

> You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was Dostoevsky and Dickens who taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who ever had been alive. Only if we face these open wounds in ourselves can we understand them in other people.

## Communication

Communication is about what is received and not what is intended. If there is a gap between what you are saying and what they are receiving, you have to find a new way to say it.

## Finding your way in life

Finding your way in life is like unlocking the combination of a safe. You have to go forwards and backwards. Life is not a direct march from A to B. The twists and turns are progress, not regression. What feels like a setback in the moment is later revealed to have been part of the path all along. Each move was necessary to get to your end goal.

## Problem with Smart People

The problem with smart people is they can come up with a good reason for not doing anything. They are smart enough to find the cracks, to foresee the challenges, and to talk themselves out of the idea. They are experts at justifying their lack of courage or lack of action with an intelligent excuse.

But there will always be reasons to not do something, and this is particularly true of anything worth doing. We value those moments in which we overcame challenge, not those in which we avoided it. Ultimately, action is a choice. The choice to emphasize the reasons for doing it despite the reasons you have for avoiding it.

## Paradox of Freedom

The way to expand your freedom is to narrow your focus.

Stay focused on saving to achieve financial freedom. Stay focused on training to achieve physical freedom. Stay focused on learning to achieve intellectual freedom.

## Mental Toughness

Mental toughness is persistence not intensity.

## The Cycle of Improvement

1.  **Awareness** - identify what you need to improve.
2.  **Deliberate practice** - focus your conscious effort on the specific area you want to improve.
3.  **Habit** - with practice, the effortful becomes automatic.
4.  **Repeat** - begin again.

## In times of uncertainty

In times of uncertainty, your habits can ground you.

When you feel overwhelmed, practice 1 minute of mindfulness. When you feel restless, do a 1-minute workout. When the world seems uncontrollable, focus on what you can control.

## Storytelling and Spreadsheets

The two skills of modern business: Storytelling and spreadsheets. Know the numbers. Craft the narrative.

## Reminding

People keep reading self-help and revisiting the same ideas because that's precisely what we need: to be reminded.

The problem is not that information is unhelpful, but that attention is fleeting. Nobody focuses on one idea every minute of the day. Good books refocus the mind.

## Motion and Action

Motion does not equal action. Busyness does not equal effectiveness.

## Incentive to change

When people say they don't want to change, what they really mean is they don't have an incentive to change.

Change the incentives and the behavior follows suit.

## Vote for yourself

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your identity. This is why habits are crucial. They cast repeated votes for being a certain type of person.

## Good habits

If you have good habits, time becomes your ally. All you need is patience.

## Opportunities that people miss

1.  Study a totally different field, then return to the original problem. Apply insights from other domains.
2.  [Invert the problem](https://jamesclear.com/inversion) . Try to achieve the opposite.
3.  Talk to hyper-creative people. Their thinking will rub off.

## Originality and Innovation

One form of originality is creation. Another form is synthesis. People often focus so much on creating new ideas that they overlook the value of synthesizing ideas from different sources. Innovation usually mean connecting previously unconnected concepts.

## Knowledge

Knowledge is the compound interest of curiosity.

## Opportunity Cost

A practical definition of opportunity cost: If you spend too much time working on good things, then you don't have much time left to work on great things.

Understanding opportunity cost means eliminating good uses of time. And that's what makes it hard. \## Driver of Results in Life There are 3 primary drivers of results in life: 1. Your luck (randomness). 2. Your strategy (choices). 3. Your actions (habits).

Only 2 of the 3 are under your control. But if you master those 2, you can improve the odds that luck will work for you rather than against you.

## 3 Level of Employees

The 3 Levels of Employees:

Level 1  
You do what you are asked to do.

Level 2  
Level 1 + You think ahead and solve problems before they happen.

Level 3  
Level 2 + You proactively look for areas of opportunity and growth in the business, and figure out how to tap into them.

As long as you are an employee, make sure you are the level 3.

## Control on Attention

The more control you have over your attention, the more control you have over your future.

## Your Problems

Your problems adjust to their true level of importance after a hard workout and a good night of sleep.

## Separate substance from style

A phrase I heard recently and found useful: I agree with the idea, but I disagree with the tone.

Many ideas get dismissed because they are delivered in a cocky or hostile or dismissive tone - or because of who delivers them. Separate substance from style.

## Focus

Focus starts with elimination, improves with concentration, and compounds with continuation.

## Self Care

Self care takes effort. It doesn't just happen. The body and mind need to be maintained. Similar to a garden, without effort, weeds will pop up and overtake everything. With a bit of consistent pruning, the results can be beautiful.

## Success and Failures

The connective tissue between your failures and your successes is the lessons you learn along the way.

It is only by going through your early attempts (usually failures in some form) that you accumulate the insights, skills, and understanding required for success.

Everything is a lesson. Learn enough lessons and the failures become useful.

## Money

Money plays an important role in life, but it can't be the only filter for how you decide to spend your time. Nobody will ever pay you to go on a date with your spouse or take your kids to the park or grab coffee with your parents.

## Habits

The most important habit is choosing the right habit to work on.

## Ambition

Ambition is when you expect yourself to close the gap between what you have and what you want. Entitlement is when you expect others to close the gap between what you have and what you want.

## Communication

It's generally better to over-communicate.

If you wait to reply because you don't have an answer yet (or because you don't want to share bad news), the other party often ends up making assumptions about what the delayed reply might mean.

Silence frustrates and confuses people. Better to communicate early and often.

## Work

It's rarely doing the work that is hard, it's starting the work. Once you begin, it's often less painful to continue working. This is why -in the beginning- it is often more important to build the habit of getting started than it is to worry about whether or not you are doing enough.

## Outcome

Imagine the outcome you want to create. Envision where you are headed in great detail. Don't talk yourself out of it. Don't encourage yourself to be realistic. You will have to wrestle with reality soon enough. Don't be your own bottleneck at this stage. What would the magical outcome be?

## Rush vs Wait

Don't rush, but don't wait.

Act with urgency, but release yourself from the need to achieve it on a particular timeline. When you think longer term than most, you can think bigger than most. If it takes years, start now.

## Learning

When you need to learn quickly, learn from others. When you need to learn deeply, learn from experience.

## Results and Habit

If two people have the same goal, you know nothing about the similarity of their results. But if two people have the same daily habits, you can infer quite a bit about the similarity of their results. Your results are largely a byproduct of your habits.

## Long term thinking

A paradox of life is that the greatest returns come in the long-term, but the opportunity cost of moving slowly is huge. Long-term thinking is not slow acting. Act fast on things that compound. Never let a day pass without doing something that will benefit you in a decade.”

## Leverage

The 2-step process for exceptional results: 1. Spend a little time each day thinking about the highest leverage activity available to you. 2. Spend a little time each day working on it.

## Ordinary vs Extraordinary Days

What you do on your ordinary days determines what you can achieve on your extraordinary days.

## Patience

Patience only works if you do. Doing the work + patience = results. Planning to work + patience = you're just waiting.

## Momentum

Momentum goes both ways. Don't move, feel sluggish. Start moving, feel like moving a little more. Don't talk, feel timid. Start chatting, conversation gets a little easier. Don't ship, feel stuck. Start creating, ideas begin to flow.

## Finishing

Finish something. Anything. Stop researching, planning, and preparing to do the work and just do the work. It doesn't matter how good or how bad it is. You don't need to set the world on fire with your first try. You just need to prove to yourself that you have what it takes to produce something. There are no artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists who became great by half-finishing their work. Stop debating what you should make and just make something.

## Feedback

The trick to viewing feedback as a gift is to be more worried about having blind spots than hearing about them.

## Delayed Gratification

The world seems to be accustomed to delaying gratification less and less, which means the rewards of delaying gratification grow more and more.

## On starting

You'll feel better once you get started.

## Compounding in life

Do one thing per day that compounds.

## Complaining

The more time you spend complaining about what you deserve, the less time you have to focus on what you can create. Focus on what you can control.

## Hard way vs the Fast Way

The hard way is the fast way.

Do it right the first time and you won't have to do it over the next time.

## Creation

The responsibility of any creator is to do the work, not judge it.

Your job is to fall in love with the process, not grade the outcome. Think about photography - job is to love the process of photography.

## Leadership

Leadership begins with your behavior. What's more powerful? A manager or coach or teacher who tells you the right thing to do? Or one who shows you how to live and work by example? People gravitate toward the standard you set, not the standard you request. \## Inspiration You have to show up before inspiration will.

## On starting

Just start. Start slow if you have to. Start small if you have to. Start privately if you have to. Just start.
